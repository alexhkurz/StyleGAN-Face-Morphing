An attempt at recreating the code from the excellent video [Editing Faces using Artificial Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCKbRCUyop8) available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LBWcmnUPoHDeaYlRiHokGyjywIdyhAQb

My attempts failed because the file [`finetuned_resnet.h5`](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1aT59NFy9-bNyXjDuZOTMl0qX0jmZc6Zb) could not be located.

I found a discussion [here](https://github.com/tg-bomze/BabyGAN/issues/12) and [here](https://github.com/tg-bomze/BabyGAN/issues/10). The next step would probably be to try to recreate https://github.com/pbaylies/stylegan-encoder/blob/master/README.md ... but that has to wait for some other time ...
